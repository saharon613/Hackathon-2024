This program intends to pack a given collection of polyominos into a given grid in the most optimal way. 
We created a list of shapes made up of up to 5 tiles and randomly generated them one at a time. 
They were then placed into a grid without overlapping. 
The algorithm for optimization we realized is extremely complicated. 
We discussed ideas of how to do so and probably would have accomplished this to a degree had we not been stuck on a bug that cause the polynomios to overlap. 
With more time, besides for optimizing the packing of the polynomios, we would expand the algorithm to cover cases such as bigger polynomios, 3D polynomios, and irregularly-shaped grids
